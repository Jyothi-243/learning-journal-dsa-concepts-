we have to prepare for the salary negotation before it came.
we have to speak for this otherwise we have to wait for the whole year for the next increment. and we have to take the stand for ourself.
HR job is salary negotating only and they are expert in this, 
AS we are software engineers , we dont have the good negotation skills.max software engineers are introverts and under confident. 
we have to prepare for the HR round, after technical interview, HR will negotatiate in salary. we have to practice generally , 
salary negotation is not a sin (because we cant work for free),

# salary negotation does make us greedy (never think like this).
they won't cancel the offer letter. (dont think in cancelling)

if we have cleared the interview and when we do that well , we are like king (so never be afraid for that )

hiring engineers is very costly thing for company.

while negotating we don't have to think like we are greedy , because  company will earn in crores and they will give us in lakhs. 

we have to say like i am doing this work and it will worth like this , i feel that i should be paid this much, and dont attach the emotions there. 

it was like job deal  job offer = money paid (and we deserve money for the work), 

if they dont like the work , they will simply say no budget like that. 

How much to negotiate and how should ? 
--> first offer letter is not the final offer letter. (they will talk about the salary in phone like that,and always there is a chance of negotation)
they will ask for the previous salary because they want to offer you for small salary. (means 2-3 lakhs only)

when we didnot negotatiate for the salary then we have lost so much money. 
when we are going to small company to big company then there will be lots of chance to negotation. 

dont undervalue yourself. 


# how to negaotatiate ? 
know the perfect value (dont undervalue yourself) . Always set a minimum bar (better work and more pay then only switch ) 
10 to 12 bad ,,10 to 14 bad (for switching in LPA) , better work will come with the better pay.  


always keep the limit for the like( 10 - 12 LPA ), before that range we dont have to switch.  
** And know about the Company's worth (
    we have to do the research , talk to existing employees ,
    go to websites like glassdoor, levels.fy  , leetcode (lot of people post their salary their), go to blind(we can ask such questions)
    when we are talking to the employees then dont ask their salaries just ask like i got the offer as SDE-1 , then ask how much can i except for that position. and i am expecting 15LPA is it ok like that,does the company gives like this? before HR talks we have find the Decent number. 
    based on the companys pay range we can negotatiate (our current salary is not deciding factor, first know our worth then negotatiate)
)

** try to avoid the questions like current salary and expected salary , if we have to give the bigger number then we have to give the bigger number. always try to avoid or say any bigger number. (always aim higher). 

if we say 10LPA then they will always settle you at 8LPA (they will feel us like low , they will make us down, make us insecure), 
if HR says we cant give you that much then we have to say like "ok HR it is negotaiable , we will discuss this once i clear the interview" and always be confident and be in upper Edge. (dont undervalue)

when we did the interview very good , then we have to be more confident. (higher chances of getting more).
interviewers give the (5 options like rating(extreme stronger, decent stronger, bad, extremely bad)) for the extreme stronger then HR will give you more package. 

if we do the interview less good then , salary negotation will be less. (if we give that best then there will be high chances of salary negotation.)

if we are nerves then , do this onCall, Email (politely say your worth/value , and after that only negotatiate. never have disputes) , never raise the voice,

### i was working in this company since long time, and i am already underpaid here. and i have upskilled myself alot , and now i have great skills. i have learned skills and i have workedup myself here and that is why i am asking for more salary. 

# convince them you are the best person to hire, tell about the skills and leading skills, ALways show the interest , if you increase the salary then you will join the next day. I am highly intreseted in this job role , this job is the perfect match i was looking for. i reaaly want to work for this company , and my interview experience was really good, *** but just one thing i want little more *** and deserve a little more because i have upskilled myself more, 

and we never clap for ourself , (like when we do the great job then we never clap for ourself. 
Be positive then we will get the confidence, if mental state changes then automatically our negotation skills changes. 
Confidence and self-worth matters here.)

make the notes of 10 good points about you and tell that to the HR. At the end of the day salary motivates us to work harder and better . 

## Always make a good switch because we will stay there for 3-5 yrs on an average. Go with the best deal that you get. 

Always have the multiple offers , and switch to the better company. Always have multiple offers and after that switch to another company. 

We have to ask for the Joining Bonous also, we have to tell like if you give me the joining bonus also then i will join in 15days, 1 month (if our notice period is 2 months) , 

Buy Back for the Company, company give us re-location bonus, (dont spend money for travelling, 
ask for more ESOPS/stocks. )

Dont leave any option for negotation. ask them for perks and benifits. (try to get the best deal out of this.)

if we cant negotiaite then we dont want the money , very bad thing. 

Be Confident. 
if you cant put decent value then over value yourself but dont under value , talk on points , talk softly 

Delay the offer time (so in that give more interviews. and try to get the best job.)

in the notice period , we have to work 100x more , reduce the sleep to 10 hrs 6-7 hrs , whole day we should grind ourself, to find out the best offer. Dont take the time lightly .

## QUote: " If you are underpaid, it's your fault. "

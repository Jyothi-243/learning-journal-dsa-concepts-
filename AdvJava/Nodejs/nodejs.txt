Being Curious will help in raising. 

While doing anything ask questions without stepping into that. (why do i write like this why do i do this , why it should be done like that ?) find answers on the internet. 

Making notes : 
Practice along with the videos.(watching dont give anything)
Best way to make the schedule(learn one video by one day) (follow the schedule properly). Have to follow. Keep gaps between the episodes and practice alot.

Episode -1:

What is node js ? (Run Java Script everyWhere) 
Node js is a Javascript Runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine.
Node js helps the JavaScript to run outside of the web browser. 
Node js has Event-driven Architecture. 

To run JavaScript , we always need a JS Engine. 

NPM is like registry , where we can add the packages to that. 
Node js history and 

Node js - Js on Server : 
Server : remote computer , 
--> Every Domain name maps to an ip address. (ip points to the server(server which is a machine)).
--> JS was used in the browser , after the node js , js can run in the node js server. 
--> Node js is C++ code. (js Engine , developed by google and used in google chrome.V8 is c++ program)
--> JS code will convert the js code to the machine code and it can understand by the browser.
--> node js is a c++ application, where V8 embedded into that. 
--> As V8 there , what is the need of the node js ?
--> inside the server , we have the node js , inside the node js , we have V8 engine.    

EcmaScript : 
a standard followed by Java Script, (v8 - google ; spiderMonkey - fireFox ; Chakra - MicroSoft) // although every browser has their own implementation of js Engines , every js engine works same like converting the java code to the machine-understandable code.  
--> V8 cannot go outside of the EcmaScript. 
--> So Node js has V8 Engine and extra super powers like (API on server.V8 cannot make the api request ,On top of V8 Node js has some super features . and it is known as the Js RunTime.)

we have to convert like High-level languages--> Machine Code --> Assembly Code --> Binary code. (machines can understand only binary code.)

Wrapping up of the Episode : Node JS is nothing but a c++ code. V8 can be embedded into c++ application , V8 executes js code.

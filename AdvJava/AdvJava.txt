creating a database: 
    create database db_name; 
    use db_name; //to go to that DB. 
    select database(); //to know we are in which database  
    show dbs; //it will show all databases.

creating table and inserting data: 
    create table table_name(col1 dataType, col2 dataType ....);
    Example: create table students (rno int, name varchar(100), class varchar(100))      //if rollno. and alphabets are mixed then we have to use varchar. 
    study mysql dataTypes. (int , BigInt , text , boolean , date , dateTime )
    show tables; //it will show all the tables in the current database. 

    inserting: 
    insert into table_name values (val1,val2,val2) //values are based on the column. 
    Example: insert into students values (12, "priya" , 'inter');

Reading/retrieving the data from the table;
    select * from students ; // "*" returns all columns.   
    select name, class from students;  //returns only name and class columns. means we can retrieve only specific columns also. kind of rule in the rows. 
    
    for the rows condition , we use where condition (for rows filtering)
    select * from students where rno=12;  // for varchar then we use Quotes where class = 'inter'; 

Update the data in the table: 
    update table_name set col = value;
    update students set name= 'jyothi" //it will set all the column values as "jyothi" , 
    update students set name = "jyothi" where class = 'inter' //it will update only the rows where the class is inter. 

Deleting data from the table: 
    delete from  table_name ;
    delete from students; 
    delete from students where rno = 12; only delete the persons whose rno is 12.  


Port for the mysql is 3306,  localhost or 127.0.0.1 
Oracle runs on the port 1521.

creating a database: 
    create database db_name; 
    use db_name; //to go to that DB. 
    select database(); //to know we are in which database  
    show dbs; //it will show all databases.

creating table and inserting data: 
    create table table_name(col1 dataType, col2 dataType ....);
    Example: create table students (rno int, name varchar(100), class varchar(100))      //if rollno. and alphabets are mixed then we have to use varchar. 
    study mysql dataTypes. (int , BigInt , text , boolean , date , dateTime )
    show tables; //it will show all the tables in the current database. 

    inserting: 
    insert into table_name values (val1,val2,val2) //values are based on the column. 
    Example: insert into students values (12, "priya" , 'inter');

Reading/retrieving the data from the table;
    select * from students ; // "*" returns all columns.   
    select name, class from students;  //returns only name and class columns. means we can retrieve only specific columns also. kind of rule in the rows. 
    
    for the rows condition , we use where condition (for rows filtering)
    select * from students where rno=12;  // for varchar then we use Quotes where class = 'inter'; 

Update the data in the table: 
    update table_name set col = value;
    update students set name= 'jyothi" //it will set all the column values as "jyothi" , 
    update students set name = "jyothi" where class = 'inter' //it will update only the rows where the class is inter. 

Deleting data from the table: 
    delete from  table_name ;
    delete from students; 
    delete from students where rno = 12; only delete the persons whose rno is 12.  


Port for the mysql is 3306,  localhost or 127.0.0.1 
Oracle runs on the port 1521.  

JDBC Project in Ecllipse IDE: 


Servlet : Servlet is a java program which can run only in the server. (tomcat, jbose...), in servlets we have to use "response.getWriter" to display the data instead of system.out.println.
we use prepared stmt to avoid sql Injection. 
--> when we are passing the data , after submitting the form , we have to send that securily, (means in the url , we dont have to send the information, so we have to method = "POST", if we dont give anything then it will take Method = GET) ,   

sending parameters to servlets: 


Creating a table : 
create table users(id int primary key AUTO_INCREMENT, name varchar(500), contact varchar(15), email varchar(250), address varchar(500), password varchar(100));     
desc tables; //to show the description of the table.

using col-span to occupy the number of rows. (col-span:2)
